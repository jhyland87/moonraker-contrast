> :warning: **Its a bit buggy**: I wrote this when I only had the Sonic Pad hooked up to my E3S1P, and it worked great. But after getting a K1C (and putting Klipper on an RPi) I see it has a few bugs with up-to-date klipper versions. The comparison logic is also a bit buggy, but that can easily be fixed. Also, the comparison logic with gcode files generated from non-prusa slicers was done using gcode examples provided to me by other users in the community, as such, the versions/format might not be the most up to date either.

# Moonraker Contrast (for gcode)

## _WORK IN PROGRESS_

## Summary
This plugin is meant to add resources that can be used to compare the slicer settings used to generate two gcode files, and is basically a simple evolution of the [gcode_slicer_diff](https://github.com/jhyland87/gcode_slicer_diff) script I wrote, but with some very notable changes.

1. Written to be integrated into Moonraker as a simple plugin.
2. Saves the processed slicer settings to the metadata object, making viewing/comparing them in the future much easier and quicker.
3. Ability to process gcode generated by other slicers other than just PrusaSlicer.
4. Settings for  _config key aliases_ and _alias_modifiers_ which make it possible to compare similar values that are used by different slicers.
	- Example: PrusaSlicer has a `elefant_foot_compensation` option for dealing with the elephants foot which takes a positive value. In Cura, this can be done with the `xy_offset_layer_0` setting which would require a negative value. Thus, comparing the two would require inverting the numerical value.




.. Ill fill the rest of this out later
